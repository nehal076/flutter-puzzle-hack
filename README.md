# Way for Ball

A slide Flutter Game.

This engaging puzzle game is really simple, but challenging at the same time. The aim is straightforward â€“ guide your ball through the maze to the exit area. The ball will not roll until you have completed the route. To create the route you must move each individual pattern and solve the puzzle. This is exactly the same as the classic jigsaw sliding games, just digital!

Some tiles are movable some are not. One with bolts on them is not movable.

The graphics are smooth, and the puzzles become increasingly difficult. This game tests your skill and logic, and is great fun to play!
